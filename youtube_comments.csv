If you turn the volume all the way up as soon as the trailer starts you can hear someone say “One of the Avengers just walked in here” and that lines up because Wade just approaches Logan, and he sees the suit and automatically thought it was Wanda Wilson hence why he said Lady, he probably thought “She” was tryna recruit him to the Avengers.",2024-06-28T01:58:35Z

@Yfitffyytuytjughh,Hey good trailer 10/ 96,2024-06-11T03:06:42Z
@VigilanteVegan,"Maybe I’m in the minority here, but I’ll say it. Just because Sony, Fox, and Disney are three separate movie studios, does NOT mean the in-story explanation has to be that the characters in the respective three are in their own distinct universe. <br><br>Case in point, I thought the post-credit Venom scene in No Way Home was unnecessary, as there’s no reason for Sony to put themselves in that hole rather than have the implication that Tom Holland’s Spider-man is somewhere out there in that world, just offscreen &amp; not referenced.  <br><br>That being said, just because MCU acquired the rights to Deadpool, does NOT mean there needs to be in-story explanation of him traveling from Fox-verse to Marvel-verse and bringing Wolverine with him through a portal. I’m all for him referencing it breaking the fourth wall, but actually doing it as a major part of the plot is another story. <br><br>The most grounded way of doing it is to imply the X-men, Deadpool, and Wolverine have been in the same world alongside other Marvel characters all along. Just because past X-men instalments didn’t reference them before, that’s perfectly fine. <br><br>The idea of characters switching universes because they change movie studios is absurd and unnecessary. The early Jason movies were distributed by Paramount. Then it switched to New Line Cinema. They never showed Jason hopping into a New Line portal so he could fight Freddy Krueger. 😂<br><br>I’m tired of multiverse stories. They’re great every vicennium as a nostalgic treat, but as a plot device for every other movie, they must go. They make the writer’s job very easy because they’re are infinite possibilities. There are no real threats and stake because a character can hop on over to Fox-verse and nab an alternate version of someone who just died. Iron Man’s death has no meaning really since they can nab a new one over in Sony-verse who happens to look like Tom Cruise. Nothing matters. <br><br>Now, compare to a story like in “The Batman” which has a grounded story without portals and potions to fill a 3-hour runtime where real things are at stake. When people die they die. These stories are harder to write. As I said, the multiverse can be fun, but it needs to go as a plot device. Ever since No Way Home, it’s being used too much.",2024-06-11T00:55:54Z

I know this Shawn Levy is like his producing partner and seems to direct all his movies now but I want that gritty Logan type script with a little less Deadpool quips and dropping in ADR of one of 10 jokes they decided on for his line.

@WYJAFAK2,Glad we get one last (?) watch of Hugh Jackman as prime Wolverine. Hopefully there’s more action sequences with him involving him stabbing and getting stabbed as I’ve never felt there was a scene in the franchise that was dedicated to just him going crazy killing people. Apocalypse wasn’t violent enough and closest thing I liked was Logan vs X24 outside the house but that was against an old Logan.,2024-05-30T13:57:32Z

Klasszikus Erdélyi Magyar Irodalom Kárpát-medencei Prózafelolvasó Versenyre hívtak meg díszvendégként, amit már korábban nagy örömmel fogadtam el. <br>Az előzetes felvételével azonban nem lehetett várni, így végül azt nem én szinkronizáltam.<br>Ezt követően - legnagyobb meglepetésemre - castingot kért a megrendelő. <br>Bár nem tudom, hogy 8 film után milyen új információt nyújthat egy ilyen felvétel a megrendelő számára, de részt vettem rajta.<br>Közel 3 hét után ma azt az információt kaptuk, <br>hogy a Disney (?) úgy döntött, hogy nem tart igényt a hangomra. <br>A fentieket azért tartottam fontosnak leírni, hogy a hírt tőlem tudjátok meg, illetve hogy ne merülhessenek fel olyan esetleges félreértések, mint hogy az anyagiakon múlt.<br>Nagyon megható volt olvasni az előzetes magyar változatára érkező kommenteket, az időközben kapott számtalan kedves levelet.<br>Valódi elismerèst csak ès kizárólag <br>a közönség adhat!<br>Nagyon köszönöm mindenkinek!<br>A  Disney döntésètől függetlenül szeretném megköszönni azt a hatalmas szeretetet, amit az elmúlt hetekben megtapasztaltam, <br>s amin még az amerikaiak sem változtathatnak. <br>Rendkívül sokat jelent számomra ez a támogatás! Hálás vagyok Nektek!<br>Ha a szinkronban ezúttal nem is, más produkciók kapcsán még biztosan találkozunk. <br>Addig is ott vannak a régi részek 😉<br>Áldás,<br>Sinkovits-Vitay András",2024-05-23T11:58:45Z

@thunderrain922,FINALLY: The Wolverine we always wanted! At least from the trailer. All these years and being that Hugh    is the perfect actor for Wolverine. They never presented him in true form. To paraphrase; They have always &quot;whisky d*ked&quot; the use of his claws in every film! No real grit. Hoping this movie changes that. We need more Wolverine movies Hugh.

Then again, he seems to be the only one who <b>gets comic fans,</b> and he&#39;d be my Board Vote to lead a studio any day. He&#39;s proven he can do it.

@SirsasthNigam.,"In an interview with The Associated Press, Levy explained why Deadpool &amp; Wolverine was made to be as accessible as possible. &quot;I was a good student in school. I’ll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,&quot; he said. &quot;I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn’t want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.&quot;",2024-04-26T05:18:55Z

@Lopez03Eduardo.,"&quot;This Wolverine let down his entire world&quot;-Paradox <br>Paradox is sort of right in some timelines Logan succeeds saving X-Men and mutant kind while other timelines he doesn&#39;t succeed and fails. <br>&quot;There’s a theory in quantum physics that time is immutable it’s like a river you can throw a pebble in and create a ripple but the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do the river just keeps flowing in the same direction&quot;-Hank/Beast<br>What if the X-Men are always meant to die in every timeline and leaving Logan to be destined to outlive everyone he ever loved and become the last X Man left regardless how many times he and X-Men try to change the timeline. <br>Logan and X-Men prevented Sentinels and erased original trilogy and the Wolverine timeline creating new timeline (X-Men First Class, DOFP, Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix, New Mutants, and Dead Pool films) where mutants are alive and become pop culture heroes similar to what MCU Avengers have become in their universe. <br>Before you say Logan 2017 takes place in this new timeline and film is set five years after Days of Future Past I&#39;m going by what was briefly discussed in the Making of Logan bonus feature with Hugh Jackman and James Mangold they intended for Logan to take place in a separate alternate timeline and when before film was released Mangold and Jackman did say it&#39;s set in an alternate timeline. <br>Logan 2017 alternate timeline instead of Sentinels who wipe out all mutants its someone from Logan&#39;s past Rice who distributed a formula that was supposedly designed to repress the mutant gene through soft drinks and breakfast cereals but it ended up killing mutants en masse his plan was to eliminate the existing mutants so that he could start over and create his own mutants to be born, bred, and sold as weapons which leaves Logan as last survivor and final X Man. So no matter how many times Logan and X-Men are the pebble thrown into timeline (river) create a ripple but the current corrects itself no matter what they do the timeline will keep flowing the same direction extinction of mutant kind.",2024-04-25T18:29:13Z

@userman4ik,"&quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&quot; is a slang term used to refer to a sexual act that involves three or more participants. The term originated from the popular Disney movie &quot;Frozen,&quot; where one of the main characters, Anna, sings a song with the same title. However, the meaning of the term has nothing to do with the movie and is instead a vulgar reference to a specific sexual position.",2024-04-25T15:50:21Z

@warrengreen46,"This will be the highlight of the year for sure. However (Spoilers)  I would say Xmen97 is directly leading up to this on Wolverines part, due to the convenient timing of the series that will finish not long before D&amp;W is out, the cartoon costume, and the fact Pool has hinted at an act3 flashback which makes me think we won&#39;t need one because we will have allready saw it. Now with Bastion ensuring a war between humans and mutants, the build up for the new guy who clearly could go nuclear, effectively combining in leaving the world in a wasteland for the Victor&#39;s (mutants) antman potentially either tried taking on a giant sentinel or became a giant sentinel hence his corpse (Pretty sure pym was mentioned by beast). Magnetos goons all there potentially because they were secure in prison during the war etc. Basically I&#39;m worried they will be wiping out the xmen97 crew :( leaving only wolverine who&#39;s mutation will likely stop him being transformed by Bastion ....",2024-04-25T11:53:19Z

@InnovatewithLes,Bruhhhhhhhh Im readyyy,2024-04-25T00:18:05Z
@WolverineMRD,"OK so here are my speculations. Based on both trailers, we see Deadpool approaching a Wolverine dressed up as &quot;patch&quot; in the first trailer, and then in this one we see him approaching Wolverine in a bar (possibly for the first time) so I&#39;m thinking that at least 2 different Wolverines (Variants) confirmed. The TVA recruits Deadpool because of his healing factor and his fighting skills because they are AFRAID of approaching any Wolverine variants to capture them (for whatever reason) so they need Deadpool&#39;s help with that because he&#39;s the only one who can do it (fight a Wolverine variant and survive), now I&#39;m expecting that the TVA tricks Deadpool because we see him killing TVA agents in the trailer so they either lie to him about why they want these Wolverine variants captured/pruned, or he just discovers something he doesn&#39;t like right after he succeeds in capturing Wolverine because we see him lying on the ground so either way Deadpool ends up turning against them but he and this Wolverine get pruned as well and get sent to the Void at the end of time (where we see the 20th century fox logo) because we also see Alioth (the cloudy looking creature) in the trailer which we saw for the first time in the LOKI series. Now we also hear Deadpool saying (&quot;I&#39;m about to lose everything that I ever cared about&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about saving worlds&quot;) and I did say earlier that he discovers something he doesn&#39;t like so that could be that he discovers that the TVA wants to prune/erase his reality (Deadpool&#39;s reality)!! So that means Vanessa, Dopinder, Al, and all the others that we see in the trailer will be gone forever and it&#39;s possibly because in his last movie Deadpool went back in time to save Vanessa (which is something that he&#39;s not supposed to do based on how the TVA works) so Deadpool starts to try and convince Wolverine to help him save his world (giving him a chance for redemption for failing to save his own) as well as finding a way to get out of the void and back to the TVA to stop them in time. I don&#39;t know if the Dr. Strange portal has anything to do with getting them out or not but they will be encountering lots of characters along the way possibly other variants. But the real villain here is the TVA. At least that&#39;s what I think, but I could be wrong though. Either way I think at least some of it is real based on what the trailer shows. At least some of it makes sense. Don&#39;t you agree?",2024-04-25T00:12:07Z

@Adeelzia007,Let me tell you what I think is going to happen remember Charls and Magneto went to logan asking for help and he said &quot;Get the f*ck out of here&quot; while sitting in a bar which led to the death of all of the X-man and maybe humans! (his World) &quot;Not him helping them&quot; This is that Logan so now we can see him sitting in a bar again where he&#39;s not welcome anymore and Deadpool comes to him. Thats why TVA accuse him of letting down his world because he didn&#39;t help them. So that&#39;s how this is his fault and now may be Deadpool convince him to help him not letting down other worlds and redeem himself this is why we can even see Deadpool fighting TVA to save him and guess what this is the reason we are hearing again and again in the trailer &quot;Get the F*ck out of here&quot;.,2024-04-24T20:43:09Z

They did a terrible job introducing Cassandra Nova, who is supposed to be Professor X&#39;s evil twin sister in an alternate universe so she&#39;s a very powerful, formidable supervillain. People need to remember that the hero is only as good as his villain.

I know he was going through a rough separation with his wife when signing onto this and Logan was such a respectful send off for the character. Was Marvel that afraid to find somebody else to play Wolverine?? Then again, Indiana Jones 4 was a proper send off and they let Mangold direct the 5th movie (which is not bad btw). Seriously though, Studios need to stop recycling characters and actors for every big movie they release. Start bringing something new and refreshing.

@phillconklin382,Looks good. I hope everyone gives it a chance. For the last few years I no longer universally support Marvel but when something looks good I definitely want to send the message that you are going in a good direction. Equally not seeing a movie is a message that no I do not think this is a good direction. Sadly with a few exceptions Marvel has lossed the fans in an attempt to modernize things. But I did quite enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and this looks very impressive and a great time.,2024-04-22T22:00:44Z

@jordonwood-13,"If Deadpool&#39;s changing history in the MCU, there are a few things I hope he changes. Like, prevented Quicksilver&#39;s death, the Avengers didn&#39;t lose to Thanos the 1st time so that means Iron Man &amp; Black Widow didn&#39;t die 5 years later &amp; Cap never went back in time &amp; stayed in the past, but still passed the mantle to Falcon, stopped Star-Lord from making that idiot reckless decision of attacking Thanos while his gauntlet was being taken off, prevented Yondu&#39;s death, changed the actor of T&#39;Challa so that means he&#39;s still very much alive, make Hank &amp; Janet younger &amp; Hank&#39;s Yellowjacket &amp; Janet is still Wasp while Scott is still Ant-Man, &amp; Hank &amp; Janet are both Avengers, prevented Photon being trapped in another universe, save Scarlet Witch from being crushed, make Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme again, prevented Spider-Man&#39;s identity to be exposed which would prevent Aunt May&#39;s death, stopped Ikaris from killing Ajak, saved Elektra from being crushed, prevented Luke Cage from going a dark path, stopping Hellcat from crossing the line, changing Hawkeye&#39;s life story so that he&#39;s married to Bobbi Morse/Mockingbird, stopping Agent 13 from going down a dark path, &amp; prevented Maria Hills&#39; death.",2024-04-22T19:50:07Z

Its part of Deadpools character to make cringey jokes and comments anyways. Granted, him calling himself &quot;Marvel Jesus&quot; shows that Marvel knows they&#39;ve sucked these last few years, so kinda not a look already. But eh, is what marvel is now, half written plot mixed with Characters cracking a one liner ever minute. I miss the level the Avengers felt, that&#39;s what a superhero movie should feel like.",2024-04-22T16:46:07Z

@thenotorioustaha,Is it just me or does this look dull? The lighting is dull. There&#39;s very little contrast. The brightness seems to be unnecessarily low. The action scenes look choppy. It looks like it was shot on a DSLR or something? Something looks very odd over here and not in a good way. I was so excited for this movie but now it seems even the story is a generic buddy film. Wolverine&#39;s motivations are literally explained to you in the trailer lmao 😭 what the hell is this? The CGI is also extremely distracting.,2024-04-22T15:23:37Z

Deadpool is my brother&#39;s biggest number 1 idol in Marvel history since l&#39;ve been showing him the very first film. He wants to have a Deadpool theme for his 11th birthday party. He also wants to dress up as Deadpool with a Hello Kitty backpack and maybe some blue crocks when we go to the theaters. And he also wants to be Deadpool for Halloween this year. And to me, The Wolverine has been my favorite Marvel super hero character since 2009. Wolverine is the best there is at what he does. But what he does best, isn&#39;t very nice and Deadpool is a merch with a mouth that never shuts up while he is awake.",2024-04-22T14:22:21Z

@Palmieres,"Okay. I collected comics for a long time. I never thought the movie adaptations were even close to decent. But Hugh Jackman has just become Wolverine for me right now. His age has been a benefit to this portrayal, because Wolverine is <i>old</i> , and while Jackman isn&#39;t as old, this right here is what Wolverine is supposed to look like. Now, I loved the character in &quot;Logan&quot;, but that is not the same &quot;golden age of the 90s&quot; character, that&#39;s someone different, made difference by even more time and trauma. That&#39;s a little diamond of a movie in the middle of mediocrity.<br>But this guy right here... this is just right.",2024-04-22T14:18:36Z

@vaishu686,Hugh Jackman is such a great actor and he has a solid screen presence. Even after so many years he&#39;s still in his Wolverine character playing so well and we can see it on screen. I can say it takes years of practice to portray a character so good that it made the  audiences believe that he is the actual Wolverine and not the character.

@infamoswordz,Besides the overbearing using foul language a filthy humor I hope people break out this film for its blasphemous joking about God. It sucks because I used to be a big fan of the series and the actors in birthday results resorted to lowbrow scraping the bottom of the barrel tactics it&#39;s overcompensate for trash content. And it sucks because all the people who are just being introduced to comics in marvel are going to think this is what the Deadpool character is about and it&#39;s not. Is pansexual God bless me cursing murdering street is Ryan Reynolds in the director&#39;s creation and not Deadpool the actual comic character Disney marvel to actually shut this thing down and create a comic book authentic version of deadpool and to bring Hugh Jackman out of his wolverine retirement for this disgraceful. I would have ended this with the IMO except for the fact I&#39;m telling the truth.,2024-04-22T14:01:22Z

Still Hyped tho.,2024-04-22T13:13:49Z
